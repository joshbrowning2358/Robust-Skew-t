\usage{
fastTLE(initial, MLE, negLogLik, data, k, trace = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial}{A vector for the initial guess for the parameters.  Results
will depend on this initial value, so it may be reasonable to run with
several starting values.}

\item{MLE}{A function which takes two arguments: data and start.  data is
supplied as an argument to fastTLE.  This function should return a
parameter vector of the same length as initial. start may not do anything
(as in the case of normal data) but must be an argument.  For
optimizations, start should be the best guess, and the last MLE will be
supplied.}

\item{negLogLik}{A function which takes two arguments: param and data.
param should be a vector of the parameters wished to optimize and data is
supplied as an argument to fastTLE.  This function is used to compute the
negative log-likelihood of the observations and hence determines which
observations are used in computing the MLE at each iteration.  Thus, it
should return a vector of negative log-likelihoods for each observation.}

\item{data}{The data which should be fed into the data argument of
likelihood.  data should be a matrix of the data.  If it's not a matrix,
fastTLE will attempt to coerce it to a matrix (with a warning).}

\item{k}{A value between 0 and 1 specifying the % of observations that
should be used to estimate the MLE.  fastTLE will use the k*100
observations with the smallest likelihood.  Note: This code was not
designed to handle ties.  This will not be a problem with continuous data,
but there could be issues with discrete data.}

\item{trace}{Should output be printed as the algorithm proceeds?}

\item{...}{Currently not implemented.}
}
\value{
A list of two elements: the estimated MLE and a vector specifying
which observations were used in the estimation.
}
\description{
An method of generating robust estimates for parameters of a distribution,
different from the capped likelihood approach.  Rather than capping the
deviance, a few of the worst observations (i.e. largest deviance) are
not used in the estimation of the MLE.  Thus, this procedure is iterative;
the worst observations may change as the MLE changes, and the MLE may
change as the set of observations used changes.  Fast TLE is an algorithm
which is NOT guaranteed to find the optimum, but typically obtains a good
approximation quickly.
