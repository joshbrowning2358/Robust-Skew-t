\title{Get Starting Estimate}
\usage{
getStartingEstimate(y, x = matrix(1, nrow = NROW(y), ncol = 1), w = rep(1,
  NROW(y)))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The data for which the skew-t is being fit.}

\item{x}{The design matrix, if y is assumed to be residuals from some fit.
This parameter has not been tested thoroughly, so use with caution!  It
defaults to a matrix of 1's with 1 column, and this is equivalent to simply
fitting a skew-t to y.}

\item{w}{The observation weights used in the skew-t fitting.}
}
\value{
An initial estimate for the density parameters.
}
\description{
This function is used to provide a reasonable starting estimate for the
skew-t parameters.  The logic replicates what is implemented in the sn
package (in particular, the st.mple function).
