\title{Get Log Likelihood Bound}
\usage{
getLogLikelihoodBound(dp, alpha = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{dp}{The density parameters of the skew-t.}

\item{alpha}{The quantile of the negative log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
The value of the negative log-likelihood that corresponds to the
1-alpha quantile of the skew-t with density parameters as provided in dp.
}
\description{
For the robust skew-t, we will occassionally need to understand which
values of the negative log-likelihood are "extreme", and this depends on
the current estimate of the skew-t parameters.  This function computes the
negative log-likelihood of the 1-alpha quantile for the skew-t distribution
with provided density parameters.
}
\details{
Caution: This is an approximation!  It is very accurate for most cases, but
it is not perfect.  In particular, when alpha is close to 1, the
approximation becomes fairly poor.  Fortunately, this is usually not a
scenario of much importance as we tend to be more interested in the case of
alpha close to 0 (i.e. the tails) rather than 1.
